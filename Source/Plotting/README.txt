The PlotterDataSource provides the values to be written by the Plotter. The data source design pattern lets the Plotter class be independent of the data that it will write out for plotting. It is expected that the PlotterDataSource will change from project to project. 

The file included here in the repository should be considered as a template and should probably not be modified. Instead, create a copy of the file outside the repository and use that for projects if you want to modify the plotting capabilities of NSLite3D. 

tl;dr Don't modify PlotterDataSource in the repository. Make your own copy.
