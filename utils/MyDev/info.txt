# that's no longer needed
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2019.4.243/linux/compiler/lib/intel64_lin/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# Instead, do :
source ~/.load_intel

# works:!!!
# make ns COMPILER=ifort WITH_MKL=y WITH_PETSC=YES

# Info :
# need to compile with option "-heap-arrays 2400000", the number over there is the size of an array (kb). any array bigger than that will be put on the heap instead of the
# stack. this examplary was optimized for running on node 16.

# Info : nice way to put in PETSc options is to do for example: 
# call PetscOptionsSetValue(PETSC_NULL_OPTIONS,"-pc_factor_levels","2",ierr)
# call PetscOptionsSetValue(PETSC_NULL_OPTIONS,"-on_error_attach_debugger","true",ierr)
# We don't need the file.
